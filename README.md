# Introduction

This is the code I wrote (copied with modifications) while taking
Mosh Hamedani's courses.

The js_basics contains the code from the JavaScript Basics course.

See https://codewithmosh.com/ for more information.

The value of these courses is not the resultant code base but the experience
of working through the tutorials and exercises and then having this
code to refer back to. You will likely not benefit much from simply
reading this file; you should take the course and write all the code yourself,
with experimentation.
